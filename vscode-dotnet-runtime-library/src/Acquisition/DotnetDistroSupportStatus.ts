/**
 * @remarks
 * Distro support means that the distro provides a dotnet sdk package by default without intervention.
 *
 * Microsoft support means that Microsoft provides packages for the distro but it's not in the distro maintained feed.
 * For Microsoft support, we currently don't support installs of these feeds yet.
 *
 * Partial support does not have any change in behavior from unsupported currently and can mean whatever the distro maintainer wants.
 * But it generally means that the distro and microsoft both do not officially support that version of dotnet.
 *
 * Unknown is a placeholder for development testing and future potential implementation and should not be used by contributors.
